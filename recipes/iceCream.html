 <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
 <p>Cookie dough ice cream is a popular frozen dessert that combines the creamy, sweet richness of vanilla ice cream with chunks of raw cookie dough. The cookie dough, typically made from a mixture of flour, sugar, butter, and chocolate chips, is specially formulated to be safe for consumption without baking. This is often achieved by using heat-treated flour and omitting raw eggs, ensuring that the dough retains its classic flavor and chewy texture while being safe to eat. The combination of creamy ice cream and soft, sugary cookie dough pieces creates a delightful contrast in texture and taste.</p>
 <p>This flavor has become a favorite among ice cream lovers due to its indulgent and nostalgic appeal, evoking the experience of sneaking bites of cookie dough while baking. It is available in various forms, from store-bought pints by popular brands to freshly scooped servings at ice cream parlors. Over time, creative variations have emerged, including options with different dough flavors like peanut butter or sugar cookie, as well as dairy-free and vegan alternatives. Cookie dough ice cream remains a timeless treat, celebrated for its playful combination of two beloved sweets.</p>
