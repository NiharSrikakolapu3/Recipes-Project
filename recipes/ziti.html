<p>Description:</P>
<p>Ziti is a type of pasta that features a distinct, tube-like shape, somewhat larger and thicker than penne. The pasta is hollow, allowing it to hold sauces, making it ideal for a variety of dishes. Traditionally made from durum wheat semolina, ziti is known for its smooth texture and firm bite when cooked properly to an al dente consistency. While ziti can be used in many pasta dishes, it is most commonly seen in Italian-American cooking, particularly in baked casseroles. The pasta’s shape makes it perfect for capturing and holding onto the sauce, making each bite a blend of sauce, cheese, and pasta that is both satisfying and hearty.</p>
<p>Baked ziti is perhaps the most famous dish that showcases this pasta. To prepare this dish, the ziti is typically boiled until al dente, then mixed with marinara or tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, and often a variety of other ingredients such as meatballs, sausage, or vegetables. Once combined, the pasta mixture is baked in the oven, allowing the cheeses to melt and bubble, creating a delicious golden crust on top. The pasta absorbs the rich flavors of the sauce and cheeses, giving each bite a balance of textures and tastes. This dish is often served as a comforting meal for family gatherings, holiday dinners, or casual weeknight meals. Its popularity is not only due to its ease of preparation but also because of its versatility.</p>
