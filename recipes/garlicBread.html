 <p> <strong>History:</strong></p>
 <p> Garlic bread is a beloved side dish made by infusing bread with a savory garlic flavor, often complemented by butter, olive oil, and herbs. Traditionally, it begins with a loaf of bread—commonly baguette, Italian, or French bread—that is sliced, halved, or left whole before being spread with a mixture of minced garlic and butter or oil. Fresh or dried parsley and other seasonings, like oregano or Parmesan cheese, may be added to enhance its taste. Once prepared, the bread is baked until the crust becomes crisp and golden, with the interior remaining soft and flavorful, or it is broiled for a slightly charred, smoky touch.</p>
 <p>Garlic bread is a versatile accompaniment, often served alongside pasta dishes, soups, or salads in Italian-American cuisine. Its appeal lies in its rich, aromatic taste and satisfying texture, making it a favorite comfort food for many. Modern variations include stuffed garlic bread, which incorporates melted cheese or additional fillings like bacon or sun-dried tomatoes, and healthier versions using whole-grain bread or vegan spreads. Whether as a standalone snack or a complement to a meal, garlic bread's simple yet bold flavor has made it a global culinary staple</p>
